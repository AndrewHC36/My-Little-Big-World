# My Little Big World 
This is a game based off of Terreria, Minecraft, and other sandbox games. What **motivated** me to build this game is the **inspiration** from the sandbox game where you can **create**, **build**, and be **creative!**. There will be 3 gamemodes, with two of them going to be survival and creative. The last gamemode is very special about this game is you can code to build your own minigame. Thats going to be very future but I am hoping this will come true! This game is still in development as it says in In-Dev (In Development).
Note: I'm currently building surival mode.

### Future stuff soon to be added:
  1. Fix/Smooth the top collision bumpy issue
  2. Fix the border issue and change how it acts when touched to the border
  3. Less sensitive jumping
  4. NEXT MAJOR UPDATE:  Add hotbar GUI, hearts.

### How to run:
  1. Download the 4 files: main.py; lib.py; gameData.py; constants.py;
  2. Than put into a folder with no other files to prevent mixing
  3. Windows ~ 
     ```cmd
     C:Users/...>cd %FOLDER LOCATION%
     C:Users/.../%FOLDER LOCATION%>py main.py
     ```

### Requirements:
  1. Niether tested nor I know 100% its going to work on other display other then 1080-1920 px, so I recommend 1080p for now.
  2. You must have a Python interpreter of at least Py-3.6 and set it on path
  3. Windows only, unless you know how to do it on Mac or Linux.
  4. Other than that there is no requirements unless you have a computer form 80's. :P


### Support/Help:
  * Help us add How to Run for mac and linux
