# My Little Big World 
This is a game based off of Terreria, Minecraft, and other sandbox games. What **motivated** me to build this game is the **inspiration** from the sandbox game where you can **create**, **build**, and be **creative!**. This game is still in development as it says in In-Dev (In Development).
