# My Little Big World 
This is a game based off of Terreria, Minecraft, and other sandbox games. What **motivated** me to build this game is the **inspiration** from the sandbox game where you can **create**, **build**, and be **creative!**. This game is still in development as it says in In-Dev (In Development).

This is how I manage the software update number. ==> NAME 1.2.3.4
NAME - (Indev, Alpha, Beta, Release)
1 - Major implementation (e.g. Placing Breaking, GUI Hotbar, etc. etc.)
2 - Fixed Bugs or smoothen (e.g. Smoother collision, More accurate placing breaking blocks, etc. etc.)
3 - Minor Bugs or In-Code improvements (e.g. Changed variables name, faster speed, etc. etc.)
4 - Builds
