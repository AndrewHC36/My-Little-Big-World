# My Little Big World 
This is a game based off of Terreria, Minecraft, and other sandbox games. What **motivated** me to build this game is the **inspiration** from the sandbox game where you can **create**, **build**, and be **creative!** 


### Indev 2.0:
  * ADDED: Terrain like Terria
  * ADDED: Collision and the collision debug mode
  * NOTE: Jumping still not working

### Indev 1.0
