# My Little Big World 
This is a game based off of Terreria, Minecraft, and other sandbox games. What **motivated** me to build this game is the **inspiration** from the sandbox game where you can **create**, **build**, and be **creative!**. There will be 3 gamemodes, with two of them going to be survival and creative. The last gamemode is very special about this game is you can code to build your own minigame. Thats going to be very future but I am hoping this will come true! This game is still in development as it says in In-Dev (In Development).
Note: I'm currently building surival mode.
